This web pages allow you to enter shiny pokemons that people have and make some statistics

If you want to help us you can download client.html, client.js and inic.css; you need to hace the folders like in the project on Github (.css in css folder and .js in js folder). Then you fill the page with your shiny pokemons and the amount of them that you've catched. Finally you press "Exportar" and generate a .txt file with your info. 

We'd be so happy if you send us that file to prshinystats@gmail.com
